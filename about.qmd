I recently participated in the original cohort of Dan Becker and Hamel Husain's _Mastering LLMs: A Conference For Developers & Data Scientists_. I eagerly sopped up every video, hungry for lessons from the experts at the cutting edge of the field.

After the course I felt I had gained a huge amount of knowledge, but I hadn't gotten my hands dirty, yet.

This blog is to change that.
